Random Number Game
Random Number Game: a 3-player game, with another process being the mediator/referee that keeps scores!
Each player is a process.
Each one of the player processes generates a random number turn after turn.
The referee process keeps track of these scores, and declares a winner once one of the players cross 100 points!
